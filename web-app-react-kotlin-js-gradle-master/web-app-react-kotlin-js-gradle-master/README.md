<h1>Kotlin Web Project</h1>

This project started as a copy of this github repository and then roughly followed the outlines of this tutorial for creating a web app:

    github: https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/web-app-react-kotlin-js-gradle
    tutorial: https://play.kotlinlang.org/hands-on/Building%20Web%20Applications%20with%20React%20and%20Kotlin%20JS/01_Introduction 

To run this project, go into the gradle menu of intellij and run "kotlinBrowser/browserDevelopmentRun" or alternatively in a terminal in the projects root directory you can use the command "./gradlew run"
