# Python Web application

This is a REALLY basic Python flask application.

## Install Flask

The easiest (and probably worst way) is to simply install Flask with pip.  There are much better ways to set things up (see the references below).

    % pip3 install Flask

## Run

    % flask run --host=0.0.0.0

In your browser, load the page at http://127.0.0.1:5000

### Success
